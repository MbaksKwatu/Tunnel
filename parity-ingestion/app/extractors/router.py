"""
Bank format detection and extraction router.

XLSX is routed by extension first. PDF detection order:
KCB → KCB_Online → Equity_CLMS → Equity_F1 → NCBA → Equity → ABSA → COOP → MPESA_PDF → Stanbic → I&M → SCB

Note: Equity_CLMS must precede NCBA because some CLMS statements trigger NCBA detection.
Equity_F1 must precede the generic Equity check since it's structurally a
distinct layout (Tran Particulars/Instrument columns, no "Running Balance").

    Detect bank format and run the appropriate extractor.
    Returns ExtractionResult on success, or UNSUPPORTED_RESPONSE dict if no format matches.

    PDF detection (currency pre-extraction + all 10 bank-format detectors)
    shares a single parse of the file (PAR-36) — previously each detector and
    the currency pre-check opened the file independently via its own
    `pdfplumber.open()` call (confirmed up to 11 opens for one document).
    The winning extractor below still does its own open for now — threading
    the shared parse all the way into each bank-specific extractor's
    column/table logic is scoped to a follow-up (see PAR-37, which needs this
    same single-parse contract to swap the word-extraction engine).

    `password` (PAR-69): a single, generic, bank-agnostic unlock step, not a
    per-bank one. If the file is encrypted, `parse_pdf()` raises
    `PDFLockedError` before any bank detector runs — at that point the
    router has no idea which bank the file is from, so there's nothing
    bank-specific to do yet. `password` is used in-memory for this call
    only: never written to a DB, config, log, or session — a later call for
    the same file must supply it again. NCBA's "e-Statement Of Account"
    template is the first caller of this path; any future locked-PDF format
    (e.g. PAR-14's Co-op Layout C) reuses the exact same mechanism instead
    of reimplementing password detection per bank.
