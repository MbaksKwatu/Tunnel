PDF type detector — distinguishes digital (text-layer) PDFs from scanned
(image-only) PDFs using pdfplumber word extraction.

Threshold: fewer than 10 words across the first 2 pages = scanned.
The 10-word buffer accommodates PDFs that carry a small text stamp (e.g. a
watermark or page number) on an otherwise image-only page.
