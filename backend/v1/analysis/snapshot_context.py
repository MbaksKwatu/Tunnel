"""
Shared snapshot-context data layer (PAR-189).

STATUS: partial extraction. Stage 1 covered Risk Assessment Summary and
Supplier Payment Analysis (both already implicated in real content-drop bugs
— PAR-188 and same-night testing respectively). Stage 2 added Transaction
Pattern Analysis and Tax Compliance Analysis. Stage 3 added Analyst Notes and
Inventory Analysis. Stage 4 added Loan Activity Detected and Loan Facilities
(one LoanActivity concept spanning two template sections). Stage 5 added
Inflow Composition and Outflow Composition. Stage 6 added Tax Payment Pattern.
Stage 7 added Inter-Account Transfer Analysis. Stage 8 added Account Coverage.
Stage 9 adds the 4-Point Reconciliation table.
The remaining ~4 sections are still computed inline in
snapshot_html_renderer.render_snapshot_html() and are NOT reachable from this
module yet. See docs/PAR-189-shared-context-schema.md for the full target
schema and section mapping, and the PAR-189 ticket comments (2026-08-20) for
the ratified schema decisions this module follows.

Stage 6 note: Tax Payment Pattern is a DIFFERENT role filter from Tax
Compliance Analysis (Stage 2) despite the similar name and shared "tax"
domain — see TaxPaymentPattern's docstring for the exact discrepancy
(role == "tax_payment" only, vs. TaxCompliance's _TAX_ROLES matching both
"tax_payment" and "kra_payment"). Confirmed by direct read of the original
inline code, not assumed from naming similarity, and preserved exactly
rather than unified.

Stage 2 note: Risk Assessment Summary's anomaly count (risk.anomaly_narrative)
now sources from TransactionPatterns.critical_count instead of a second,
separately-computed anomaly loop — Stage 1 duplicated that computation because
Transaction Pattern Analysis wasn't extracted yet; Stage 2 removes the
duplication now that it is.

Stage 3 note: Inventory's days_inventory_outstanding and turnover are kept as
raw, UNROUNDED floats (not the Optional[int]/pre-rounded form one might
expect) specifically so the WeasyPrint adapter's f"{value:.0f} days" /
f"{value:.1f}x" formatting reproduces the original single-step computation
exactly — rounding once in the data layer and again in the adapter risks a
rounding-order mismatch, the same reasoning already applied to Percent in
Stage 1. extraction_confidence is also kept a plain float, deliberately NOT
wrapped in Percent — the original template displays it as "0.87", never
"87%", so treating it as a Percent (which the WeasyPrint adapter would
multiply by 100) would silently produce the wrong number.

Stage 5 note: Segment.share (Inflow/Outflow Composition) is NOT each
segment's true fraction of the total. The original computes each segment's
displayed percentage as max(1, int(total/grand_total*100)) — an integer
floor with a minimum of 1% for any included segment — and the "Other"
bucket's percentage as 100 minus the SUM of the other segments' already-
floored percentages (a chart-must-sum-to-100 residual, not other/total on
its own). Both are display-layer artifacts of the original, not a
recomputable property of the segment's raw amount. Preserved exactly:
share.value stores that already-computed integer percentage divided by 100,
not amount/total. Recomputing a "true" share here would silently change
what every segment displays.

Stage 7 note: InterAccountTransfer carries a semantic `state`
(DETECTED / NO_TRANSFERS_FOUND / UNAVAILABLE) rather than the original's
inline badge text ("Detected" / "No Transfers Found" / "Not Available") — the
badge string is presentation and now lives in the WeasyPrint adapter, per
ratified decision #5. The NO_TRANSFERS_FOUND vs UNAVAILABLE distinction is
load-bearing and must never be collapsed: the first means detection ran and
genuinely found nothing, the second means the pre-PAR-102 per-account tagging
gap makes detection structurally impossible. Reporting the second as the
first would be a false negative on a real financial claim.

Stage 8 note: Account Coverage is the first section where ratified decision
#5 does substantial work — the original carried three separate CSS-class
lookup tables inline (advisory tier -> stat colour, materiality -> status
pill, submitted/missing -> status pill) plus a pre-rendered "✓ Submitted"
label. All four are presentation and now live in the WeasyPrint adapter; the
context carries only `Materiality` and `AccountSubmissionStatus` enums.

Stage 8 also found and fixed a REAL latent formatting divergence introduced
by Stage 1, not a hypothetical one: `coverage_pct` reaches this layer already
rounded to hundredths (round(basis_points / 100, 2)), and storing it as a 0-1
`Percent` then multiplying back by 100 to format reintroduces float error.
For 45 of the 10,001 possible basis-point values that changes the rendered
digit (e.g. coverage_pct 0.85 rendered "0.9" instead of the original "0.8").
Stage 1's Risk Assessment adapter had been shipping that divergence since PR
#161; it was invisible to every stage's byte-diff because the Deed document
has no audited financials and renders "--" for coverage on both sides. Both
call sites now format via _fmt_pct_1dp() in snapshot_html_renderer.py,
which re-rounds to hundredths first. See that helper's docstring.

Format-agnostic per PAR-189: nothing returned from this module contains HTML,
CSS class names, hex colours, or markup. Each renderer (WeasyPrint today,
reportlab later) owns its own mapping from these typed values to
presentation — see _supplier_payments_ctx_from() / _risk_assessment_ctx_from()
in snapshot_html_renderer.py for WeasyPrint's adapter.

    Inter-Account Transfer Analysis (PAR-63, live-checked per PAR-102).

    `state` is the semantic three-way result, NOT a badge string — per PAR-189
    ratified decision #5, each renderer owns its own state -> label mapping
    (WeasyPrint's lives in _inter_account_transfer_ctx_from()). The original
    computed the badge text inline ("Detected" / "No Transfers Found" /
    "Not Available"); that text is presentation and does not belong here.

    The three states are the original's three branches, preserved exactly:
      DETECTED            — real pds_transfer_links rows exist for this deal.
      NO_TRANSFERS_FOUND  — zero links AND 2+ distinct account_id values, i.e.
                            detection genuinely ran and found nothing.
      UNAVAILABLE         — zero links AND <2 distinct account_id values, i.e.
                            the pre-PAR-102 per-account tagging gap. This is an
                            infrastructure limitation, NOT a finding of "no

                            the three-way split and must not be collapsed.

    Per ratified decision #1, the "missing" case carries a null value plus a
    separate reason rather than an overloaded field: `total` is None and
    `pair_count` is 0 for both non-DETECTED states, with `state` carrying the
    reason. Per decision #2, `note`/`override_note` stay as pre-written prose

    months" (cashflow_note), "Monthly Cashflow Pattern (PAR-63)"
    (trend_note/peak_trough_note), and "Monthly cashflow chart rows" (rows).
    All three read the same monthly_merged/period_months derived from
    _monthly_cashflow(canon_tagged) — the original's own comment confirms
    single source, no independent recompute — so they move together here.

    period_months/neg_months are cheap to recompute; the renderer still does
    so locally for Observed Patterns (not yet extracted this stage), same
    accepted-duplication precedent as Stage 9's kms/recon_rows finding — this
    is not a hidden coupling back onto this function.

    No percentage field in this section's original scope is a pre-rounded
    hundredths value being round-tripped through a 0-1 fraction (the
    Stage 8/9 bug pattern) — checked explicitly. bar_pct/bar_share is a
    live ratio (abs(net)/max(abs(net))) computed fresh here every time, never
    stored-then-reformatted elsewhere, and the original's `int(...)`
    truncation (not round()) is preserved exactly in the renderer's
    _monthly_cashflow_ctx_from() to avoid introducing any new rounding
    divergence.

    4-Point Reconciliation (PAR-189 Stage 9), transcribed from the original
    inline block in render_snapshot_html().

    Four fidelity points preserved deliberately:

    1. **Cash position is never coverage-softened.** The original calls
       _status_to_badge(cash_status) with NO coverage_incomplete argument,
       while the other three pass it. That is deliberate and documented in
       the original: the declared Note 11 balance is the company's own
       attestation of total cash, so a variance there is genuinely
       unexplained regardless of which statements are missing. Here that
       becomes _resolve_recon_status(..., coverage_incomplete=False).
       Cash also never gets missing_note appended to its assessment.

    2. **Each row derives its status differently**, and the differences are
       real, not incidental:
         - cash  : raw `status` field, no coverage softening
         - revenue: parsed out of the free-text `assessment` string by
                    substring match ("HEALTHY" / "WARNING" / "RISK"), NOT
                    from any status field
         - expenses: purely from the gap magnitude vs the config threshold;
                     the sub-dict's own status field is ignored entirely
         - loan  : raw `status` field, defaulting to "VARIANCE" when absent
       Unifying these onto one rule would silently change badge outcomes.

    3. **`abs()` in the assessment strings is applied to the raw
       already-rounded value**, formatted here in the builder, so it never
       makes the 0-1 round trip. Only ReconCheck.variance does, and the
       renderer must use _fmt_pct_1dp() for it.

    4. **Assessments append missing_note only when the resolved status is
       COVERAGE_GAP**, matching the original's `if badge[0] == "b-warn"`.

    Fidelity points preserved deliberately:

    1. The available/unavailable branch keys off `coverage_pct is not None` —

       has no coverage_pct, and the original correctly renders the locked
       state for it. Keying off anything else would flip that case.

    2. `bank_name` and `materiality` use `or`-style fallbacks in the original
       (falsy -> "--"), while `advisory_tier` and `recommendation` use
       `.get(key, default)` (absent -> default, but present-and-None would
       fall through as None). For every dict calculate_account_coverage() can
       actually produce, all four keys are present and non-empty whenever
       coverage_pct is present, so the two forms cannot diverge on real data.
       They are carried here as plain Optionals with the renderer applying the

    section is pure static markup — see the Stage 9 report). This is NOT yet
    the full 57-key SnapshotContext from docs/PAR-189-shared-context-schema.md

    metadata, tier badge, doc pills, period label, QR code) are still
    presentation-only or genuinely renderer-local and were never in scope for
    this extraction; see the PAR-189 Stage 11 report for the final accounting.

    This function does its own independent deal/txn/recon fetch rather than
    being fed data already fetched by render_snapshot_html() — see the
    PAR-189 report for why that duplication exists and what it means for
    render_snapshot_html() itself (a separate, not-yet-started piece of work).
